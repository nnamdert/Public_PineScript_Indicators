# Public_PineScript_Indicators
All of the code for my nnamdert Public Pinescript Indicators.

Some of these "Public" facing indicators are available and published on Tradingview itself.
Some of these are NOT available on Tradingview and are NOT published.
The Indicators that are NOT published are available for use by simply copying the code and pasting it into the pine editor.

Please check the Copyright Status of each code as each of the scripts are different. 
1. Some are listed as opensource, but are copyright nnamdert.
2. Some are open source and can be used freely but not redestributed for profit or changed in any way.
3. Some are fully available for use, reuse, resale, reformatting etc.
